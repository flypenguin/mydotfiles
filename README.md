# Dotfile collection

This is my personal dotfile setup. Is it cool? You bet. Are there cooler ones? You bet. Do I care? Not so much.

Anyway, feel free to use it (as inspiration or just clone it).


## Quickstart

```
# for Mac
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flypenguin/mydotfiles/master/setup/mac.sh  | bash

# for Arch Linux (currently untested & probably NOT WORKING)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flypenguin/mydotfiles/master/setup/arch.sh  | bash
```


## Plans

Maybe create a "setup_linux.sh" command. So far this works pretty well for me.
