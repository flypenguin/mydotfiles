# Dotfile collection

This is my personal dotfile setup. I think it's pretty cool.

It uses stow and some fancy (read: probably crappy) shell fu maneuvers to manage my personal dotfiles over a range of systems (Mac, Linux - Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu).

It should be a one-stop-shop to get my personal environment up and running.

Anyway, feel free to use it (as inspiration or just clone it).


## Quickstart

```
# for Mac
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flypenguin/mydotfiles/master/setup/mac.sh  | bash

# for Arch Linux (currently untested & probably NOT WORKING)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flypenguin/mydotfiles/master/setup/arch.sh  | bash
```
